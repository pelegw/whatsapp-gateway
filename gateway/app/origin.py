"""Origin lockdown for public (Cloudflare-fronted) deployment.

When the gateway is reachable on a public IP, Cloudflare sits in front but the
origin is still directly addressable by anyone who learns the IP. Two guards:

1. A shared secret header that a Cloudflare Transform Rule injects on every
   proxied request. Requests without it never went through Cloudflare -> 403.
2. The real client IP is taken from CF-Connecting-IP, but ONLY after guard 1
   passes, so a direct-to-origin caller cannot spoof their source IP.

Both are no-ops until `origin_secret` is configured, so local/dev runs and the
test suite behave exactly as before.
